						As discussed on last night’s W33KLY G33K-OUT (G4R’s 199th radio broadcast might I add), I have for you Ubisoft’s financial reports for 2012-13. For those of you who are not big on numbers, I will give you the short version: Ubisoft is putting in work. They are setting realistic goals for their titles, which is allowing them to better budget their time and money. Just Dance is making bank in the casual games department and Assassin’s Creed 3 is leading the charge for hardcore gamers. With the “surprising” sales of Far Cry 3, they have reestablished themselves in the shooter genre. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Ubisoft has seen solid growth over the last year taking sales numbers from €1,061.3 million in 2011-12 to €1,256.2 million in 2012-13. Gross profits have taken a substantial leap from €718.1 million to €913.5 million. R&D (Research & Development) costs have gone up—which is to be expected when expanding and making blockbuster titles—from €348.4 million to €428.2 million over the last year. All and all, Ubisoft is in an increased Net cash position of €104.6 million over their 2011-12 position of €84.6 million. Overall solid work in getting revenue up and more money circulating through the company.

					</p>
					<p>
						Chief Executive Officer for Ubisoft, Yves Guillemot, had this to say about this improvement: "In 2012-13 fiscal year our financial performance outstripped the targets that we had announced a year ago, notably with non-IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) operating income up 79 percent and higher-than-expected cash generation. The expertise and talent of our teams enabled Ubisoft to manage the years difficult market conditions and the drop in the casual segment remarkably well. In addition, the success of Far Cry 3 confirmed our strong comeback in the major segment of shooter games.” Guillemot continued "We began fiscal year 2012-13 with two major franchises: Assassins Creed and Just Dance. Twelve months later, we have substantially extended our reach by establishing Far Cry as another major franchise, building upon the great potential for our newest brand, Watch Dogs, and making our online/digital segment an increasingly significant part of our business. The steady rise in our operating and financial performance during the last three years is the direct result of the long-term investments we have made, with the continued development of our creative capacity and the bolstering of our expertise in online activities.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Fiscal year sales were up 18.4 percent (€1,256 billion- around $1.619 billion US) for 2012-13 (or 13.5 percent at constant exchange rates) when compared to last year’s €1,061 billion. Fourth quarter sales for 2012-13 were up 8.7 percent (or 9.9 percent at constant exchange rates) at €175 million over the €161 million mark they hit at the same time last year. This is yet another example of Ubisoft’s practice of setting realistic goals and meeting or exceeding them. They were a mere €5 million from hitting their max target sales figures as issued during the third quarter of 2012-13.
					</p>
					<div id="chartContainer2" style="height: 350px; width: 600px;"></div>
					<p>
						Ubisoft’s solid performance in the 2012-13 fiscal year can be attributed to four main points:
						1) €928 million in revenue created by games for core gamers which is a 60 percent year on year increase. This grand return to the forefront of games for gamers was spearheaded by record breaking sales for Assassin’s Creed 3 (more than 12.5 million sell-in and digital units) and Far Cry 3 (6 million sell-in and digital units) which were complemented by sustained revenues of free-to-play title The Settlers Online.
						2) €328 million in revenue from casual games though this is a drop from last year’s numbers. 2012-13 saw Ubisoft’s casual game market accounted for only 26 percent of total sales whereas 2011-12 they were at 46 percent. Just Dance is still holding its own as an industry mainstay with 8.5 million units sold-in and a decline of just 14 percent in revenue in value terms.
						3) A major boom in online/digital sales which saw an 86 percent increase to €148 million (which includes core and casual game figures listed above). This accounted for 11.7 percent of the company’s total sales.
						4) A bit of a give and take on back-catalog titles which saw a 4 percent decrease to 206 million. However, a sharp growth in online and digital back-catalog purchases helped offset the drop in retail back-catalog purchases
					</p>
					<p>
						As you can see, Ubisoft is on a solid up-swing. Last year was a great year for them and as long as they stick to the strategies that have brought them this far, they would be hard pressed not to continue on this successful path. With announcements for Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag and Watch Dogs, it is fairly clear that Ubisoft is on board to continue making games for gamers as long as we show our support for the good work that they do. As they say, one hand washes the other and both wash the face. Let’s continue this mutually beneficial relationship and I think we will all be very happy with our future gaming.
